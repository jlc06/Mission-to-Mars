# Mission to Mars

## Purpose
Through the use of BeautifulSoup, Splinter, Flask, and our budding understanding of HTML and Bootstrap, Robin and I created a website that scraped the web and pulled in updated data from a variety of sources to build out a broad overview of Mars. Our goal was to get noticed by NASA through our polished site and ability to obtain information from around the web and supply it in one easily digestible outlet. Let's hope it worked!
